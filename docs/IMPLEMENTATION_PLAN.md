# zBANK Java Application - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the initial plan for converting the zBANK project from COBOL to Java.

## Project Structure
- `src/main/java/com/zbank`: Core Java source code.
- `pom.xml`: Maven project configuration.
- `docs`: Documentation related to implementation decisions and architecture.

## Persistence Mechanism
Initial consideration for persistence will be an in-memory map for simplicity during early development, with a plan to migrate to a lightweight embedded database (e.g., H2 or SQLite) or flat files based on further analysis of data volume and complexity.

## Next Steps
1. Implement core banking functionalities (e.g., account management, transactions).
2. Develop a robust persistence layer.
3. Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests.
